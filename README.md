#SFML Project Directory

This is be a place where all my current/future SFML projects will go. My goal is to get better at C++ and learn some cool game development patterns and concepts while doing that.

To Run these projects:
1. Make sure you have SFML installed on your computer
2. Go into any project directory
3. Run the makefile to build the project!
