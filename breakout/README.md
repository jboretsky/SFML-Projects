# Breakout

This is my first project with SFML. I was working on this while reading through the SFML game development book. Therefore the code uses a lot of the data structures from the book. This includes:

- Scenegraph
- Command queue system
- State stack system
- Texture mapping
- Key mapping
- Pickups

I also implemented a level manager so that you can customize levels in media/levels.txt
